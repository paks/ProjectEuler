///Project Euler Problem 27
///Euler published the remarkable quadratic formula:
///
///n + n + 41
///
///It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive values n = 0 to 39. 
///However, when n = 40, 402 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41 is divisible by 41, and certainly when n = 
///41, 41 + 41 + 41 is clearly divisible by 41.
///
///Using computers, the incredible formula  n 79n + 1601 was discovered, which produces 80 
///primes for the consecutive values n = 0 to 79. The product of the coefficients, 79 and 1601, is 
///126479.
///
///Considering quadratics of the form:
///
///    n + an + b, where |a| 1000 and |b| 1000
///
///    where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n
///    e.g. |11| = 11 and |4| = 4
///
///Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic expression that produces the 
///maximum number of primes for consecutive values of n, starting with n = 0.
///
/// A: (71, -61I, 971I)
